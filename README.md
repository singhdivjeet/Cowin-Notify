<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![alt text](https://github.com/shubhpatr/Cowin-Notify/blob/main/arch.png)

A simple website, that will register users looking for coronavirus vaccine slots. At the time of its implementation, slots were very few and users often lost the chance to book the slots as they were released sporadically. 

This application will bridge the gap, and send an instantaneous notification to its users as soon as slots are available. 

https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin - Cowin API used for the application

We are using MERN stack to build the application, and a simple python smtp script to send notifications to our users. So far, we have helped more than 1000 users accross India.
